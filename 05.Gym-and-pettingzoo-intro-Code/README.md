# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with PettingZoo

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using the PettingZoo library in Python. The game supports three modes:

1. Random Agent vs Human Player
2. Human Player vs Random Agent
3. Human Player vs Human Player

The game environment is rendered in a human-readable format, allowing players to interact with the game through the console.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PettingZoo library

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iw4p/Reinforcement-Learning.git

## How to Play

- In the Human vs Human mode, two players take turns to enter their moves. Each player inputs the position they want to place their symbol (X or O).
- In the Human vs Random mode, the human player competes against a computer-controlled opponent that makes random moves.
- In the Random vs Human mode, the human player plays against a random agent, which selects its moves randomly.
